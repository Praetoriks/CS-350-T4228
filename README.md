Project Thermostat

The two projects I’ve included in this repository are the first project we did in this class, our alternating LEDs, and the final project which involved creating a prototype working thermostat that detects the ambient air temperature, creates a temperature point that will cause the “heat” to turn on, and displays the output to the user. I also provided, programmatically, the functionality to change the set point where the heat turns on. This goal was achieved by implementing drivers that allowed us to use board resources to our advantage.
    
While working on this project, I believe that I was able to successfully integrate the drivers into the program effectively. I used these drivers to communicate with the hardware and implement the required functionalities, while simultaneously accounting for the constraints common to the embedded systems we are using. Furthermore, I created a visual representation of the thermometer prototype as a task scheduler and state machine. When it comes to making improvements, there is a lot I can work towards, including just a better understanding of these systems overall. For this project in particular, I would want to work on the modularity of the program, with the end goal of improving readability.
    
My support network will have the addition of ZyBooks for as long as the access exists, as well as the notes I’ve taken from it. I’ve also done a bit of research and found a couple of sources that were useful such as this tutorial from Auburn.Edu - https://www.eng.auburn.edu/~nelson/courses/elec3040_3050/C%20programming%20for%20embedded%20system%20applications.pdf
    
In essence, all of the skills I’ve gained from this project and class will be applicable to any future work I do as it was mostly a process of learning as you go, which is a useful skill in any industry. The extra coding practice I garnered from learning C will also apply to any programming job I may embark on, not to mention the efficiency we had to practice when dealing with the limited development boards we used from Texas Instruments.
    
When ensuring that my code was readable, maintainable, and adaptable, I followed the standard coding best practices outlined in our readings, such as keeping the code as simple and portable as possible, as well as following naming conventions.
